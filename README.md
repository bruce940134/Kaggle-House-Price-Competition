House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

Kaggle Competition at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

The notebooks are my implememtations of machine learning regressors for the competition.

The models are coded in Python and using libraries such as scikit learn, Pandas, and Numpy.

The notebooks with sklearn in the titles are machine learning models imported from the scikit-learn, xgboost, lgbm, cat-gb libraries.

Applies techniques:
  - Data Transformation
  - Data Scaling
  - Feature Engineering
  - Polynomial Features
  - One-hot-encoding
  - Feature Selection
  - Outlier detection
  - Model Stacking
  - Hyperparameter Tuning
